dead cheerleader

acid on he-man in high school
prostitute or gutter-punk
graduated on school so wet
rain nor snow
broken arrow
broken hello
laughter in mine head and ears...
none to turn to
i have everyone
all are gone this weekend
at the hoot-inn-nanny
where we have our legs crossed
and our eyes peeled
like lemons or oranges or limes
giggle water, please.
enough to kill a dead elephant!
oh cheer practice
christ mass tree
stigmatilda nor exercise class?
science rennaissance
for space to giggle nor cry
love nor like...
super sized
lost in the woods for all to miss
faked nor farced
droth nor doomed
redeamed hopefullness nor pride and glory
we miss our mascots
win the heavens you name
in afterworld on high school
micro orbit
on block-head nor bong!
reality nor cognition
complexion not learned video game control
complexion nor remote reflection
mirrors only are melted
with the he-man acid on dead cheerleaders
funeral rains
times the music nor video?
awaken! melted in a pool of after glow
and bright moonlit dawns
with a living spirit
nor soul of holy entropy and symbiosis
binary coeds tight beaver-tails
ad astra Haumea
i really had so much rhyme to tell you.
but you danced the night a away away...
for to live another day
future star
phantom ghost warrior
seven peices of centers
where celebrations make window to modes
...though the dead cheerleader was only
a justification for harmony nor balance
she did stand long and tall
in time and in prayers, but
when was pired to fly and away,
by flames of freedom or liberation
and learned an answer for rapture
the dusk arose and conjured a name:
_______
you must know this name
for to fly from cages
where libraries reside
books to read in front of pools of 
knowledge when the time is four
the time is five...?
twain blended in madness like romance
drink and holding honestly to each
others hearts
beating inthe oven to make warm the
rhythm of this name:
_______
