dirt makes rust
makes flowers smell sweet
honey stolen from a killer bee
aerospace personel 
in caverns alive wild in regolith Mars
Touch me down upon the lilith Venus
set the stand of all justifications
make trees love humans
...and for her name to be for legends
 
once and again you can still hear her voice
in your tree whisping with a bird's melody
baby of He-Man...what is your name?
_______.
you friends have all but been destroyed
now can you live with a cheerleader?
feathers and flowers
railroads only lead by illegal transport
jumping trains-to mental institutes
conservatories and field labs
magick and projections.
